# PAX Wireframe 3D test
I was recently inspired again to try making 3D graphics.
This repository contains a test for 3D rendering in wireframe form.

## Features
Three viewing modes are cycled by pressing 🅰:
- 3D projected to 2D
- Red/Cyan 3D anaglyph
- Orange/Blue 3D anaglyph

Pressing ← decreases the eye distance of the anaglyph.
Pressing → increases this distance.
